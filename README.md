**English** | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

If your environment supports `npx` you don't need to install `easy-commitizen` anywhere
You just need to open a terminal in the root of your project and run the following command

```shell
$ npx easy-commitizen
```

## Install

Of course I recommend you to install `easy-commitizen` globally, so that you can use it easily and quickly next time.

```shell
npm install -G easy-commitizen
```

## Usage

Once installed in the global environment, go to the root of your project, open a terminal and run the ec command

```shell
$ ec
```

tip: please make sure your project has used git, If not, you can use the following command to initialize

```shell
$ git init
```
